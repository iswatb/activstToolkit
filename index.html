    <h1>Fight  For  Palestine</h1>

<p id= "p1"> <strong>Palestinians need your help.</strong> This website is designed to provide you with resources to help get involved and educate your self on the crisis they are facing. Since 1948 when Israel officially became a state, despite many of the Palestinians already living there opposing, Palestinians have been under oppression from the Israeli governement. <strong>Women, Men, and Children are being murdered</strong> for not wanting to leave thier homes. They are jailed for protesting for thier rights and left to die. This has been goin on for a long time now but we can not just "wait it out", if we don't take action now, Palestinians will continue to suffer and we all have been complacent in thier colonization. Currently the IDF (Israel Defense League) is heavily backed financially by the western superpowers, America, France, and Britain to name a few. This allows them to have the massive funds to maintain one of the strongest militaries in the world who's sole purpose is to oppress Palestinian people. They are being forcibly evicted from their homes, jailed for protesting, bombed, and murdered by officers. No one deserves this and <strong>if you stand for Human Rights, you should stand with Palestine.</strong> </p>
