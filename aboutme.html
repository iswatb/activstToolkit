    <h1>Fight For Palestine-About Me</h1>

    <img id="me" src="assets/me.jpg" alt="a picture of me">
<p id="p2"> My name is Iswat Banjoko and I am 15 years old. Originally from Lagos, Nigeria, I now live in Houston, Texas. I first head about what was going on in Palestine a few months ago on the social media app TikTok. There were a lot of videos at the time asking people to help out and spread awarness so I got interested, but unfortunately not long after, those videos were starting to get taken down and people were being banned for speaking on the topic of Palestine. Even though those videos were becoming less frequent on my For You Page, I was still interested in what was going on and decided to start reading about it. What I found was hearbreaking and is what led me to make this website. I was tired of feeling helpless, and when the oppurtunity to make an activist website aorose in my Coding class, I realized I had to take it. I hope this website will provide you with some resources to help and get educated. My end goal is to provide Palestinians with support all the way from here and to hopefully enact real change. Thank you. </p>
